<h1>Text Replacer

My plan with this project is to open files types .doc and .txt, find keywords within them, and replace those keywords.

This program idea stems from the tiresome process of creating cover letters that address specific companies and positions.

After I create the initial functions to accomplish this task, I plan turn it into a CLI-ran module by creating an argument parser.
